### 7. Use the Strings window to locate the string \cmd.exe /c in the disassembly. Where is it located?

At 0x10095B34 in the xdoors_d section

![Location of the string "\cmd.exe" in the program](lab05_01_dll_strings_rce_location.png)

### 8. What is happening in the area of code that references \cmd.exe /c?

looking into the functiohn code that has the cmd.exe string, we can see that there's alot of comparison happening in the assembly code. This is probably condition checking on the input accepted by the malware. The string comparison includes comparing them with "uptime", "install", "cd", "inject". The function also consists some strings that shows that the malware is a reverse shell program. Finally, the function also use  multiple send and recv function which are involved in communicating with a server. These evidence shows that this is a remote reverse shell session function.

### 9. In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set dword_1008E5C4? (Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4â€™s cross-references.)

Checking the usage of dword_1008E5C4 in the file, we can see that the value of dword_1008E5C4 is changed at 0x10001678, which involve moving the EAX value register value into dword_1008E5C4. Now, to figure out how we got the EAX value, we need to look into the previous subroutine call  sub_10003695. This is because EAX will contain the return value of a subroutine call. In the subroutine, we can see that a call to GetVersionEx, which contains the version of the machine operating system. The dwPlatformId member of OSVERSIONINFOA (returned from initializing GetVersionExA while using a OSVERSIONINFO structure as the parameter) will return the value 2 if the Operating System operating the program is using older Windows OS such as Win XP, Win7, Win Vista, etc. If dwPlatformId returned '2' as its value, then the 'cmp' instruction will result in setting the AL register value to 1. Which will in turn, make dword_1008E5C4's value to be 1.

### 10. A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of comparisons use memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string comparison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0)?

In the subroutine 0x1000FF58 there are a lot of memcmp function call, and at loc_10010468 the "robotwork" memcmp function call is at 0x10010452. If the memcmp returns 0 (if the string matches "robotwork"), the jnz instruction will not be executed. If that's the case, the sub_100052A2 subroutine will be called. In this subroutine, the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion registry key is opened and two registry value is requested, namely "WorkTime" and "WorkTimes". Then, the information is sent to the network socket opened up previously in subroutine sub_100038EE.

### 11. What does the export PSLIST do?
### 12. Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79. Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?
### 13. How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many at a depth of 2?
### 14. At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code executes?
### 15. At 0x10001701 is a call to socket. What are the three parameters?
### 16. Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants functionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful? What are the parameters after you apply changes?
### 17. Search for usage of the in instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes the in instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?
### 18. Jump your cursor to 0x1001D988. What do you find?
### 19. If you have the IDA Python plug-in installed (included with the commercial version of IDA Pro), run Lab05-01.py, an IDA Pro Python script provided with the malware for this book. (Make sure the cursor is at 0x1001D988.) What happens after you run the script?
### 20. With the cursor in the same location, how do you turn this data into a single ASCII string?
### 21. Open the script with a text editor. How does it work?
