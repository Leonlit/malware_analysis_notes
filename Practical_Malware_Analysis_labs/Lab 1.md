1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?

**lab01-01.dll **

**lab01-01.exe **
![[Pasted image 20220411161519.png]]

2. When were these files compiled?

Well using PE-bear I was able to get the compilation file.

**lab01-01.exe **

3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?

Using PEiD the files seems to be not packed
