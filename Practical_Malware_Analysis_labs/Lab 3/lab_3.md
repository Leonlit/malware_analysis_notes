## Lab 03-01

### 1. What are this malware’s imports and strings?

The binary seems to be packed as viewed in PE-bear. Then using PEiD it seems that the binary is packed with a tool called PEncrypt. When viewed with PE-Bear, there seems to be one import only. But after executing the binary, more imports can be viewed using the process hacker.

### 2. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?

There is three host based IOC that could be used to detect the malware activity. The malware would create a mutex named WinVMX32. It would also change the value of the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry and  the VideoDriver registry in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\VideoDriver.
